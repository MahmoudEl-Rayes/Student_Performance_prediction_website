## Overview

Traditional academic monitoring often reacts after students begin to struggle. This **Student Performance Prediction System** takes a proactive approachâ€”collecting data on study habits, sleep patterns, extracurricular involvement, social interactions, physical activity, and stress levelsâ€”and leverages machine learning to forecast GPA and performance levels (Excellent, Good, Average, Below Average). Early warnings and personalized recommendations help students and advisors intervene before grades suffer.

## Motivation & Problem Statement

University students balance academics with many lifestyle factors that influence success. However, most systems focus only on grades and attendance, missing underlying causes of poor performance. Our system:

- **Identifies atâ€‘risk students early**, enabling timely support  
- **Analyzes holistic data** (behavioral, psychological, and academic)  
- **Provides tailored recommendations** to improve study habits and wellâ€‘being
